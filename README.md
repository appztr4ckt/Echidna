# Echidna


This is a server software that I got from JTE and found on my PC.
I’m not exactly sure how it works, but it requires something called Perl. 
I think it allows all classic clients to join, but I’m not sure if it will work with RetroCraft.

The software could start different maps with a command, shutting down and booting back up really quickly. 
It runs on Perl, which is its own programming language, and I barely remember it.
